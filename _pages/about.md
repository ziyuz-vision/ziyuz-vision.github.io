👨🏻‍💻 Currently I'm a 4th year Ph.D student at University of South Carolina under Prof. [Song Wang](https://www.cse.sc.edu/~songwang/).

🔬 My research focuses on computer vision, particularly multimodal learning, image inpainting, segmentation (2D/3D), 
and 3D reconstruction.

📚 I’m currently working on advancing multi-modality pretraining and tuning, as well as generative models for 3D reconstruction.

📽️ I am also interested in assisting others on their path in the world of Deep/Machine Learning and academia.
